# Dental-Cavities-Diagnosis
A project done to assist the doctors with a Machine Learning model to diagnose cavities in the OPG X-ray of the patient

Developed a Deep Learning model using TensorFlow and RCNN to assist doctors in diagnosing cavities from Orthopantomography (OPG) X-ray images. Employed data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance and accuracy.

Deployed the solution as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, enabling seamless and efficient analysis of patient X-rays for medical diagnosis.
